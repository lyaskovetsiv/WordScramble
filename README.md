# WordScramble

APP: WordScramble

Description: A small application written as part of the "SWIFT Marathone" walkthrough according to Paul Hudson's textbook "100 days of Swift UI". This is a game for two people, the goal of which is to make up as many words as possible from a given random word.

Several checks have been added to the logic of the game:
- the word should not repeat the starting word
- the number of characters must be more than 3
- words should not be repeated
- the word can be composed from the starting word
- the word is written without mistakes

Tech Stack: SwiftUI, MVC
